# FullStackProject
Based on JavaScript Applications

Problem Statement:
There are many websites on the internet which provide only games, but our idea is to
create a website through which users can learn while playing games. So, basically we are
promoting the idea of learning with fun. Considering that, we are building all our
applications as a game through which a user can learn while playing.


Objective:
The aim of our project is to target thousands of users to use and engage with our website.
We have decided to work on this project because most of the people face the same
problem when they want to relax their mind but don't want to waste their time on any
game which has no use. So, to overcome this problem we will build a website where
users can improve their skills with fun and also manage their work.
We will build an interactive user interface with the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
Bootstrap which illustrates the things in an efficient way so that it is easy to use and
understand.
We are making applications like a Typing Speed game so that users can relax their mind
with improving their typing skills. Our next application will be ToDo List; with the help
of this application users can manage their work and life in a very easy and efficient
manner. Our last application will be Simon Game, which will help users to increase their
memorizing power.
